It is a sensorless BLDC motor with 3 outputs used to turn CDs in computers. It can be operated with a simple L298n motor driver using Arduino or Stm32 board. The motor is rotated by energizing the windings respectively. Speed control is done with waiting times. The current is read from the analog reader and the power is cut for protection in high currents.
