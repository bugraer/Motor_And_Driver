In this article, 6/4 (stator / rotor) combination motor and driver circuit is designed. Motor geometries were obtained in line with the calculations required for the motor. Inductance graph is simulated on matlab with reference to one phase of the motor. Flow characteristics are examined in terms of moment outputs, flux densities and flux lines. As a result of the comparisons, it has been shown that the moment wavelength decreases as the number of stator / rotor poles increases and the power and moment intensities are directly proportional to the number of stators / rotors.
